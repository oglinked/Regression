Documentation for Guns Data
-------------------------------
Guns is a balanced panel of data on 50 US states, plus the District of Columbia (for a
total of 51 “states”), by year for 1977 – 1999. Each observation is a given state in a given
year. There are a total of 51 states × 23 years = 1173 observations. These data were
provided by Professor John Donohue of Stanford University and were used in his paper
with Ian Ayres “Shooting Down the ‘More Guns Less Crime’ Hypothesis” Stanford Law
Review, 2003, Vol. 55, 1193-1312.
