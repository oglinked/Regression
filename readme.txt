Hi there!
------------------
The tasks are placed in "exercise_1.txt" text file.
The data to analyse - in "guns.xlsx" excel file.
Be careful! If yor excel file has another name, please change it onto "guns.xlsx".
In "definitions.txt" text file are all definitions you need to now.
To make your statistical calculations, you have to double click first "project_1_1.py" python program, than (after the program will be finished) - double click second "project_1_2.py" python program.
All results of calculations you need will be in text file "guns_output.txt".
Your attention please!
These results are only for task A) (please see "exercise_1.txt")
Good luck!

P.S.
The files guns.xlsx, project_1_1.py, project_1_2.py have to be in the same folder.
To run python program you need to have Python on your computer.
